# Rust By Example Tutorials
This repository contains source code and executables relating to the [Rust By Example][RBE] set of tutorials provided by the [Rust Team](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's the result of my (in progress) efforts to learn Rust.

## Contents
This repository's structure mirrors the structure of the [Rust By Example][RBE] documentation. Primary Headings are indicated below. See the individual README page in each directory for detailed contents thereof.

### Directory Structure
Each top-level directory contains the following assets:
- `README.md` : Describes the contents of the top-level directory in more detail
- `src/`: contains the `.rs` source code files associated with the directory
- `bin/`: contains the executables corresponding to the source, as compiled with `rustc`.

Note that this structure is subject to change in the future as complexity increases.

### Top-Level Directory Listing
A filled checkbox next to a directory indicates that the section is complete. An unfilled checkbox indicates that work is still in progress.

|Directory|Description|Completed?|
|---|---|---|
|[Hello World](./hello_world/)| Contains a basic "Hello World" Application, as well as various programs that demonstrate the concepts of comments and formatted print.| - [ ]|
