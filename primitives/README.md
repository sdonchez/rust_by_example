# 1. Primitives
The "Primitives" section contains applications that explore the various primitive types, as well as tuples, arrays, and slices.

## Contents
See the [top level README](/README.md) for a description of the folder structure contained herein.

|Application|Description|Links|
|---|---|---|
|`Literals and Operators`|Demonstrates the basic numeric and boolean types, as well as common operators such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. Also demonstrates bitwise operations.| [src](./src/literalsAndOperators.rs), [bin](./bin/literalsAndOperators), [log](./log/literalsAndOperators.log)|
|`Tuples`|A demonstration of the use of tuples, or collections of values of different types, as well as the manipulation of tuples.|[src](./src/tuples.rs), [bin](./bin/tuples), [log](./log/tuples.log)|
|`Arrays and Slices`|A demonstration of the properties of arrays, or sequences of similarly typed objects, as well as slices, which point to a section of an array.|[src](./src/arraysAndSlices.rs), [bin](./bin/arraysAndSlices), [log](./log//arraysAndSlices.log)|
